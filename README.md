# imdb-dataset-prediction
The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive (1) or negative (0). The goal is to predict the sentiment of a review using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).  RNNs are ideal because they can process sequences of words and remember context through their hidden states, making them perfect for text data.
